# Plants of Westpark (Munich)

That's API of the Westpark's (Munich) map with recognized plants, their descriptions (wiki), photos and geolocations.

Database with plant's geolocations, descriptions and so on lies under MySQL and is managed by backend PhotosPlantsGeolocations, https://github.com/MyropolskyiHennadii/PhotosPlantsGeolocations.

I don't know, how long I will pay for VPS, but now you can see the working application here:
